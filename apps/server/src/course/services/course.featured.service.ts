     * Retrieves featured courses ranked by a comprehensive scoring algorithm.
     * 
     * This function calculates a featured score for each course using a weighted formula that
     * combines course-specific metrics, organization reputation, and instructor credibility.
     * 
     * **Scoring Formula:**
     * The featured score is calculated as a weighted sum of normalized metrics from three categories:
     * 
     * **1. Course Metrics (Primary Factors - Weight: 0.95):**
     *    - Total Enrollments (weight: 0.30): Number of students enrolled in the course
     *    - Total Reviews (weight: 0.25): Number of reviews the course has received
     *    - Average Rating (weight: 0.25): Average rating score (0-5 scale, normalized to 0-1)
     *    - Total Views (weight: 0.15): Number of times the course has been viewed
     * 
     * **2. Organization Metrics (Secondary Factors - Weight: 0.36):**
     *    - Average Courses Rating (weight: 0.10): Organization's average rating across all courses
     *    - Total Courses Reviews (weight: 0.08): Total reviews across all organization courses
     *    - Total Enrollments (weight: 0.10): Total enrollments across all organization courses
     *    - Total Courses (weight: 0.08): Total number of courses in the organization
     * 
   * **3. Instructor Metrics (Tertiary Factors - Weight: 0.50):**
   *    - Average Courses Rating (weight: 0.16): Instructor's average rating across all their courses
   *    - Total Courses Reviews (weight: 0.14): Total reviews across all instructor's courses
   *    - Total Students (weight: 0.11): Total number of students across all instructor's courses
   *    - Total Courses (weight: 0.09): Total number of courses taught by the instructor
     * 
     * **4. Recency Factor (Weight: -0.03):**
     *    - Newer courses receive a slight boost to promote fresh content
     *    - Calculated as: (course_age_in_years * -0.03)
     * 
   * **Scoring Process:**
   * 1. **Filtering**: First attempts to get courses with minimum thresholds
   *    - Course must be published (`settings.isPublished = true`)
   *    - Must have at least 1 enrollment and 1 review
   *    - If not enough courses meet these criteria, fills remaining slots with recent courses
   *      (published courses sorted by creation date, newest first)
     * 
     * 2. **Data Aggregation**: Joins course data with:
     *    - Organization collection (for organization stats)
     *    - Users collection (for instructor stats)
     * 
     * 3. **Normalization**: All metrics are normalized to prevent outliers from dominating:
     *    - Metrics are divided by normalization factors (e.g., enrollments/1000, reviews/100)
     *    - Ratings are scaled from 0-5 to 0-1 range
     * 
     * 4. **Logarithmic Scaling**: Applied to high-variance metrics for better distribution:
     *    - Enrollments: Uses log scaling to reduce impact of extremely popular courses
     *    - Views: Uses log scaling to balance view counts
     *    - Reviews: Linear scaling (no log)
     * 
     * 5. **Capping**: Normalized values are capped to prevent extreme outliers:
     *    - Example: Course enrollments capped at 5000 normalized value
     *    - This ensures no single metric can dominate the final score
     * 
     * 6. **Weighted Calculation**: Each normalized and capped metric is multiplied by its weight
     *    and summed together to produce the final featured score
     * 
     * 7. **Sorting & Limiting**: Courses are sorted by featured score (descending) and limited
     *    to the requested number of results
     * 
     * **Configuration:**
     * All weights, normalization factors, caps, and thresholds are defined in
     * `featuredCourses.config.ts` and can be adjusted without modifying this code.
     * 
     * @param limit - Maximum number of featured courses to return (default: 10)
     * @returns Promise resolving to an array of featured courses with their calculated scores,
     *          sorted by featured score (highest first). Each course object includes:
     *          - All standard course fields (id, name, description, pricing, stats, etc.)
     *          - `featuredScore`: The calculated numerical score used for ranking
     *          - `organizationStats`: Aggregated statistics from the course's organization
     *            (totalCourses, totalEnrollments, totalCoursesReviews, averageCoursesRating)
     *          - `organization`: Basic organization information (id, name, slug)
     *          - `instructorStats`: Aggregated statistics from the course's instructor
     *            (totalCoursesReviews, averageCoursesRating, totalStudents, totalCourses)
     *          - `instructor`: Basic instructor information (id, username, firstName, lastName, profile)
     * 
     * @example
     * ```typescript
     * // Get top 10 featured courses
     * const featured = await courseFeaturedService.getFeatured(10);
     * 
     * // Get top 5 featured courses
     * const topFive = await courseFeaturedService.getFeatured(5);
     * 
     * // Access the featured score
     * featured.forEach(course => {
     *   console.log(`${course.name}: Score ${course.featuredScore}`);
     * });
     * ```
